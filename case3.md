3 Buddha Finally Turns the Wheel3

舉。世尊臨入涅槃4。文殊請再轉法輪。世尊咄云。吾四十九年住世。未曾說一字。汝請再轉法輪。是吾曾轉法輪耶。

Right before Buddha died, Manjsuri asked him to transmit again the dharma. Buddha snorted scoldingly and said, "[During] my 49 years of living, I haven't said a word. You ask me to transmit again, have I previously transmited5?

代文殊云。世尊末後殷勤。

[Xutang's teaching:] On behalf of Manjusri, I say, "Buddha is finally really industrious".

3) Dahui's Shobogenzo, Cleary trans: "When the World Honored One was about to enter nirvana, Manjusri asked the Buddha to turn the wheel of Dharma again. The World Honored One scolded him, "I remained in the world for forty-nine years, but never had a single word to give people. You're asking me to turn the wheel of Dharma again - this implies that I have already turned the wheel of Dharma." So in the present time, setting up guest and host in the community, with questions and answers, is a matter than cannot be helped, just for the sake of beginners."

4) sje397: "涅槃" brings new meaning to "a tray of lacquer"; the two characters are translated as 'Nirvana' but individually they can be 'blackness' and 'tray'. Also interesting that 轉法輪 can be 'turn the wheel of the law'.

5) benastyer: [Alternately] "Thou asks me to transmit once more. Is this not itself my transmission?" or "Thou asks the Wheel to turn again. Is the Wheel not already turned?"

6) Alt trans from river_in_egypt:

世尊臨入涅槃 - In the moments before the World Honored One finally joined in the extinction of the dead,

文殊請再轉法輪 - Manjushri, the Buddha of understanding, extended an invitation to him: "Explain the Way for us, one more time."

世尊咄云 - The World Honored One made a noise of disapproval with his mouth, and said,

吾四十九年住世 - "My entire life, all 49 years of it,

未曾說一字 - I have relentlessly failed to explain anything to people.

是吾曾轉法輪 - You ask me to explain it to you 'again.' It's just like I said before!"

代文殊云 - Xutang: If I'd been Manjusri I'd have said, "Finally, he's paying attention."
