Buddha: The Awakened One

Manjusri: "Mañjuśrī is depicted as a male bodhisattva wielding a flaming sword in his right hand, representing the realization of transcendent wisdom which cuts down ignorance and duality. The scripture supported by the padma (lotus) held in his left hand is a Prajñāpāramitā sūtra, representing his attainment of ultimate realization from the blossoming of wisdom. Mañjuśrī is often depicted as riding on a blue lion or sitting on the skin of a lion. This represents the use of wisdom.. which is compared to riding [] a ferocious lion." He is one of the Four Great Bodhisattvas of Chinese Buddhism, the other three being Kṣitigarbha, Avalokiteśvara, and Samantabhadra. In China, he is often paired with Samantabhadra.- Wikipedia

Case:

舉。世尊一日。見文殊在門外立。乃云。文殊文殊何不入門來。文殊云。我不見一法在門外。何以教我入門。

Citing: One day Buddha saw Manjusri1 standing immediately outside the entrance. Manjusri! Manjusri! Why not come in? Manjusri said I do not see a method of doing so out here. How [or "from where"] can you teach me to enter?

代云。啟予者多。

Xutang: Speaking on behalf the reader: You give me many entrances.

Sayings and Doings of Pai-chang (Baizhang) #21: "Manjusri is the principal, leading bodhisattva of this world, yet because he pointlessly created the idea of seeing Buddha and the idea of hearing the Dharma, he was overcome by the Buddha’s inconceivable power and cast down between the two iron enclosing mountains. It is not that he does not know how to specially act as a standard for students; he is commanding all students of later times not to create such seeing and hearing. Just have no doctrines of existence, nonexistence, etc., no views of existence, nonexistence, etc. - one by one pass through and beyond the three states. This is called the wish-fulfilling jewel; this is called jewel flowers supporting your feet."

On the Transmission of Mind (Huangbo) #5: "Manjusri represents fundamental law and Samantabhadra, activity."

Shobogenzo by Dahui, Treasury of the Eye of True Teaching #274: Master Linji said... "Do you want to know Manjusri? Your present functioning with never any aberration, unobstructed everywhere - this is the living Manjusri. The undifferentiated light in your mind in each moment wherever you are is all Samantabhadra."

.

Shobogenzo by Dahui, Treasury of the Eye of True Teaching #634: Master Changqing Yan said... "When the World Honored One was about to enter nirvana, Manjusri asked the Buddha to turn the wheel of Dharma again. The World Honored One scolded him, "I remained in the world for forty-nine years, but never had a single word to give people. You're asking me to turn the wheel of Dharma again - this implies that I have already turned the wheel of Dharma." So in the present time, setting up guest and host in the community, with questions and answers, is a matter than cannot be helped, just for the sake of beginners."

No Way
One day Buddha saw Monju (a legendary Buddha representing Wisdom) standing outside the gate. He said, "Monju, Monju, why don't you come in?" Monju said. "There is no 'way' outside the gate. Why do you ask me to come in through the gate?"

Master Kido
You have taught me much.
