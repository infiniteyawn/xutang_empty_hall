Expirement to see how this works for people. Linking will be the most important part.
stick to .md files so you can use links, comments, formatting etc.

beware that tabs are double-spaces which is a reddit line break.

I will pull down the results and do a sort of heueristic search later on and get it to spit out some links to places where the characters have shown up elsewhere.

To Search for characters in this repository, try this:

https://github.com/infiniteyawn/xutang_empty_hall/search?q=repo%3Ainfiniteyawn%2Fxutang_empty_hall+%E5%AE%9A%E6%B3%95

See, easy!
