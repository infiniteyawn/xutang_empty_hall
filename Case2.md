舉。世尊因。外道問。昨日說何法。云。說定法2。又問。今日說何法。云說不定法。外道云。昨日說定。今日何說不定。世尊云。昨日定今日不定。

Citing: A non-Buddhist asked Buddha, "Yesterday you spoke what law"? Buddha said, "I spoke the concrete dharma," "What did you preach today?" "I spoke the indefinite [lasting for an unknown or unstated length of time] dharma." "You spoke concrete dharma yesterday, why did you preach the indefinite dharma today?" Buddha said, "It was established yesterday, but it is not established today."

代外道。相顧而去。

[Xutang's teaching:] Speaking on behalf of the non-Buddhist, "Mutually attending [to what is concrete] but apart from it".

2) spinozabenedicto: '定法' also occurs in the 7th section of the Diamond Sutra. 如我解佛所说义，无有定法，名阿耨多罗三藐三菩提，亦无有定法如来可说。It should mean fixed/concrete dharma according to this and this. Baidu also translates 不定 as aniyata, sanskrit for indefinite. It seems Hoffman mistakes 不定法 for impermanence.
