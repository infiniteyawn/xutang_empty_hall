Xutang Translation: 9, the Love Potion
r/Zen translation project: https://www.reddit.com/r/zen/wiki/xutangemptyhall

Update: Xutang continues to be controversial, but not if you don't read him! This Case is controversial in so many ways, see if you can name just two! The translation experience seems to yield three different types of translation problems:

A computer could do it, very simple.

Slightly complicated, Ancient Chinese translators are a big help

Zenplicated, if you don't study Zen no amount of translation experience is going to help.

舉。豐干因。寒山子問。古鏡不磨。如何照燭。干云。氷壺無影像。猿猴探水月。山云。此是不照燭也。更請道。干云。萬德不將來。教我道甚麼。寒拾俱作禮而退。

代云。因我致得。

Hoffman:
Hanshan asked Master Fenggan, "If an ancient mirror is not polished, how can it reflect the light of a candle?" Fenggan said, "A crystal vessel filled with ice has no shadow. A monkey reaches for the moon in the water." Hanshan said, "Such things do not reflect light. Will you go on with your talk?" Fenggan said, "If these are of no help, what do you want me to say?" Hanshan bowed and withdrew.

MASTER Xutang: He thinks that by my answer he understands.

Note: "Hanshan shi 寒山詩 (Poems of Hanshan), 2 fascicles. Full title Hanshan shi ji 寒山詩集; also known as the Sanyin ji 三隠集 (Collection of the three recluses). A collection of the poems of the three semi-legendary hermits Hanshan 寒 山, Shide 拾得, and Fenggan 豊干, who are said to have lived at or around the temple Guoqing si 國清寺 on Mount Tiantai 天台. It is not known exactly when Hanshan lived; estimates of his dates range from the seventh to the ninth centuries. He is said to have written his poems on rocks and walls around Mount Tiantai; these were later written down by Lü Qiuyin 閭丘胤 (n.d.), the traditional editor of the collection. Fascicle 1 of the text contains Hanshan's poetry; fascicle 2 contains poems by Shide and Fenggan. There are several editions of the work, all having a preface by Lü Qiuyin and a postscript dated 1189 by Zhinan 志南 (n.d.) The earliest extant edition dates from the Song. The collection is one of the most widely read works in all of Chan literature." -Terebess, quoting somebody, Snyder?

r/zen translation:
Hanshan Zi asked Master Fenggan, "When the old mirror isn't polished, how can it reflect a candle."

Gan said, "A cold pot is not the image of a cold pot; monkeys explore the moon in the water."

Shan said, "This is not confirmation of illumination! Please say something concerning the Way."

Gan said, "The 10,00 virtues (all of them) are not in the future."

Master Han wrote the entire record and withdrew.

Xutang said on behalf of others, ""Because I usually permit it."
