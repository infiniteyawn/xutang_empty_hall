8 Not Bowing to Buddha
舉。忠國師因。虞軍容問。師住白崖山時。如何修行。師喚童子。以手摩頂云。惺惺直言惺惺。歷歷直言歷歷。向後莫受人謾。軍容無語。

A military official named Yun Junrong1 asked National Teacher [Nanyang] Zhong, "When the Master dwelled on White Cliff Mountain for a season, how did he practice Buddhism?"

Zhong called over a boy, used his hand to rub the top of his head, and said, "Those who understand speak with understanding. Those with experience speak with experience. Following that, do not accept people who deceive."

Junrong was speechless.

代云。弟子此去。更不禮佛。

Xutang said, on his behalf, "This disciple will no longer bow to Buddha".

Notes:

From Wumenguan: 禮 = bow, 更不 = no need
