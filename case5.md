5 Cloud Nail Dharma
舉。忠國師因。肅宗皇帝問。師在曹溪得何法。師云。陛下還見空中一片雲麼。帝云。見。師云。丁釘著懸挂著。

Citation: Because the National Teacher [to the Emperor] Nanyang Huizhong was so honest, Emperor Su Zong asked him, "What dharma did you obtain at Cao Xi [at Huineng's place]?"

Nanyang Huizhong said, "Does you majesty see a sea of clouds in the sky?"

The Emperor said, "I see them."

Nanyang Huizhong said, "Are they pinned to the sky or hung there?"8

代云。曹溪何在。

Xutang said: Speaking for the reader, "Where is Cao Xi?"

Nanquan said to a chief monk, "What Sutra are you lecturing on?"

The monk replied, "The Nehan Sutra."

Nanquan said, "Won't you explain it to me?"

The monk said, "If I explain the sutra to you, you should explain Zen to me."

Nanquan said, "A golden ball is not the same as a silver one."

The monk said, "I don't understand."

Nanquan said, "Tell me, can a cloud in the sky be nailed there, or bound there with a rope?"
