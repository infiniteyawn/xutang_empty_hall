6 Payment of Debt
舉。忠國師問南泉。甚處來。泉云。江西。師云。還將得馬大師真來否。泉云。只者是。師云。背後底聻。泉休去。

Master Nanyang Huizhong asked Master Nanquan, "What abode do you come from?

Nanquan said, "Jiangxi province [in the South, where Mazu lived]"

Nanyang Huizhong asked, "Have you paid your dues to Mazu?"

Nanquan said, "The payment is This".

Nanyang Huizhong asked, "There is a dead ghostly spirit behind you".

Nanquan ceased speaking and went away.

代南泉。以脚一抹便行。

Xutang, speaking for Nanquan: Using one foot to wipe away appropriate Zen conduct.

Note: The translation for this was very difficult, particularly Nanyang's line about the dead ghost and Xutang's teaching on the Case. Arguably other translators have tried to make sense of this translation by trying arranging the rest of the translation based on a translation of these two lines.
