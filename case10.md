舉。布袋和尚。常將布袋并破蓆。於通衢往來。布袋內盛鉢盂木履魚飯菜肉瓦石土木諸般總有。或於稠人處。打開布袋內物。撒下云。看看。又一一將起問人云。者箇喚作甚麼。眾無對。

代云。醜婦顰眉。

Hoffman:

Budai always strolled around the streets, carrying a cloth sack and a torn carpet. The cloth sack was filled with pots, bowls, wooden clogs, fish, rice, vegetables, meat, tiles, rocks, clay, wood, and all kinds of things. Sometimes, in a crowded place, he would open the sack, empty it, and say, "Have a look." Then he would pick the things up one by one and ask, "What is this called?" The crowd was dumbfounded.

MASTER Xutang: The ugly woman frowns.

Xutang: [On behalf of others] Disgrace's wife knits her brows in confusion.

Notes:
Budai appears in very few Cases. He appears in Transmission of the Lamp although it is not a Zen text. Also in his Cases is someone named Bailu.

Here is a fragment from a poem attributed to him:

Ten thousand dharmas, what is special; heart, why different? Why spend labor searching meaning in sutras? Heart is originally self-ruled, separate from knowledge Wise ones only realize there is no end to study Neither mundane nor sacred – what then?
