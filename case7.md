7 Come See Me
舉。忠國師因。麻谷到。乃振錫一下。卓然而立。師云。汝既如是。何用見吾。谷又授錫一下。

Citation: Once, Mayu Baoche8 came to see Master Nanyang Huizhong, the National teacher. Immediately upon arrival, he shook his ringed staff one time. The teacher said, "You are already thus. Why come to see me?" Gu again shook his staff.

代云。子合見吾。

Xutang: Disciples, come and see me.

Notes:

Ringed Staff - (Wikipedia, unsourced) "In Chinese monasteries, the 錫杖 symbolizes the abbot's administrative authority. When ascending the platform during large ceremonies, the abbot takes the khakkhara and strikes the ground three times while shaking it, symbolizing the breaking of ignorance and calling out to all beings"

BoS case 16 because there are some similar characters:

舉。麻谷持錫到章敬。遶禪床三匝振錫一下。卓然而立(可曬有禪)。敬云。是是(且信一半)。谷又到南泉。遶禪床三匝振錫一下。卓然而立(來朝更獻楚王看)。泉云。不是不是(也且信一半)。谷云。章敬道是。和尚為什麼道不是(棺木裏睜眼)。泉云。章敬即是。是汝不是(雪上加霜)。此是風力所轉終成敗壞(殺人須見血)。

Case: Magu, ringed staff in hand, came to Zhangjing; he circled the meditation seat three times, shook his staff once, and stood there at attention.(He sure has a lot of Chan.) Zhangjing said, "Right, right."(For the moment I believe in half of it.) Magu also went to Nanquan, circled the meditation seat three times, shook his staff, and stood there at attention.(Tomorrow morning, try to make yet another presentation, to the king of Chu.) Nanquan said, "Wrong, wrong."(I believe half of this for the moment too.) Magu said, "Zhangjing said 'right'--why do you say 'wrong'?"(He's bulging his eyes inside his coffin.) Nanquan said, "Zhangjing is right--it's you who's wrong.(He adds frost to snow.) This is something that can be blown by the power of the wind--it inevitably disintegrates." (When you kill someone, you should see blood.)

(Cleary trans)

You can see he also translates "振錫一下" as "shook his staff once".

Footnote:

8) 麻谷寶徹 Mayu Baoche: "Little is known of Mayu 麻谷, who lived at Mount Mayu in Puzhou 浦州 in the southern part of modern Shanxi. He is identified by certain old commentators as Baoche 寶徹 (n.d.), the first abbot of the monastery at Mount Mayu and one of Mazu Daoyi’s heirs. However, Baoche was considerably older than Linji, so other commentators sug- gest that the Mayu mentioned in the Linji-lu is Baoche’s disciple, who was presumably the second abbot of Mayu. In the Linji-lu Mayu appears twice, but it is clear that these are merely two accounts of the same incident." (Thomas Yūhō Kirchner)
